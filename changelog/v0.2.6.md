## New Features

### Bun SQL Client Support

Added `BunClient` for Bun's built-in SQL client. This allows using linkgress-orm with Bun runtime's native PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite support.

```typescript
import { BunClient, DataContext } from 'linkgress-orm';

// Connection string
const client = new BunClient("postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb");

// Or options object
const client = new BunClient({
  hostname: "localhost",
  port: 5432,
  database: "mydb",
  username: "user",
  password: "pass",
});

// Use with DataContext
const db = new MyDatabase(client);
```

Features:
- Full transaction support via `sql.begin()`
- Connection pooling with `sql.reserve()`
- Multi-statement query support via `.simple()` mode
- Works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite

### Full Change List
- Added `BunClient` for Bun runtime's built-in SQL client support
