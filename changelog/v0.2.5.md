## Bug Fixes

### `delete()` with Navigation Properties in WHERE
Fixed `delete()` not generating proper JOINs for navigation properties used in WHERE clauses. PostgreSQL DELETE requires `USING` clause for JOINs instead of standard JOIN syntax.

```typescript
// Before: Crashed with "missing FROM-clause entry for table"
// After: Correctly uses USING clause to join related tables
await db.cartItems
  .where(p => and(
    eq(p.cart.uuid, cartId),
    flagHas(p.product.mode, ProductMode.TARIFF)
  ))
  .delete();
```

Also fixed:
- Multi-level navigation in `delete()` (e.g., `ot.task!.level!.name`)
- `RETURNING` clause column ambiguity when using navigation properties
- Subquery conditions combined with navigation properties in `delete()`

### Full Change List
- Fixed `delete()` to detect navigation property JOINs and use PostgreSQL `USING` clause
- Fixed `RETURNING` clause to qualify columns with table name when using `USING` to avoid ambiguity
- Added comprehensive tests for `delete()` with navigation properties and subqueries
