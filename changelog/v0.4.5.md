## Feature: Auto-create schema on fresh database in MigrationRunner

### `MigrationRunner.up()` now detects fresh databases and bootstraps the schema automatically

When `MigrationRunner.up()` is called on a completely fresh database (no tables at all), it now automatically creates the schema from the model definition before running journal migrations. Previously, calling `up()` on a fresh database would attempt to run migration files against a schema that didn't exist yet, causing failures.

**New behavior:**
1. Check if the journal table exists (without creating it)
2. If **no journal table** (fresh database): run `db.getSchemaManager().migrate()` to diff-create the schema from the model, create the journal table, and mark all existing migration files as applied
3. If **journal table exists** (existing database): proceed with normal migration flow — load files, diff against journal, run pending

```typescript
const runner = new MigrationRunner(db, {
  migrationsDirectory: './migrations',
  verbose: true,
});

// On a fresh database, this will:
// 1. Create the full schema from the model definition
// 2. Record all existing migration files as already applied
// 3. Return them as "skipped" (not "applied")
const result = await runner.up();
// result.skipped = ['20260101-120000.ts', '20260102-120000.ts', ...]
// result.applied = []

// On subsequent runs, normal migration flow resumes
```

Existing migration files are marked as "skipped" in the result (not "applied") to distinguish schema-bootstrapped migrations from actually-executed ones.

### Files changed

- `src/migration/migration-journal.ts` — Added `tableExists()` method that checks `information_schema.tables` without creating the table
- `src/migration/migration-runner.ts` — Modified `up()` to detect fresh databases via `journal.tableExists()` and auto-bootstrap the schema before running migrations
